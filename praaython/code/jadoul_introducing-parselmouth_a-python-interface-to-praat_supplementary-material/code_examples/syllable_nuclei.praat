# modified 2010.09.17 by Hugo Quen√©, Ingrid Persoon, & Nivja de Jong
# Overview of changes:
# + change threshold-calculator: rather than using median, use the almost maximum
#     minus 25dB. (25 dB is in line with the standard setting to detect silence
#     in the "To TextGrid (silences)" function.
#     Almost maximum (.99 quantile) is used rather than maximum to avoid using
#     irrelevant non-speech sound-bursts.
# + add silence-information to calculate articulation rate and ASD (average syllable
#     duration.
#     NB: speech rate = number of syllables / total time
#         articulation rate = number of syllables / phonation time
# + remove max number of syllable nuclei
# + refer to objects by unique identifier, not by name
# + keep track of all created intermediate objects, select these explicitly,
#     then Remove
# + provide summary output in Info window
# + do not save TextGrid-file but leave it in Object-window for inspection
#     (if requested in startup-form)
# + allow Sound to have starting time different from zero
#      for Sound objects created with Extract (preserve times)
# + programming of checking loop for mindip adjusted
#      in the orig version, precedingtime was not modified if the peak was rejected !!
#      var precedingtime and precedingint renamed to currenttime and currentint
#
# + bug fixed concerning summing total pause, feb 28th 2011

# modified 2018.02.07 by Yannick Jadoul
# Changes:
# + replaced "directory" parameter by "fileName" and removed loop over
#     all files in the directory to a single execution of the algorithm
#     over this one file
# + removed output in CSV format
# + removed the 'Keep_Soundfiles_and_Textgrids' argument
# + selected sound plus textgrid at the end of the script
