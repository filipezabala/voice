# https://depts.washington.edu/phonlab/resources/f0-F1-F2-intensity_praat_script.praat
# This script opens each sound file in a directory, looks for a corresponding TextGrid in (possibly) a different directory, 
# and extracts f0, F1, F2 and intensity from the midpoint(s) of any labelled interval(s) in the specified TextGrid tier.  
# It also extracts the duration of the labelled interval(s) as well as labels from other intervals located at the same midpoint(s) on other tiers. 
# All these results are written to a tab-delimited text file.
# The script is a modified version of the script "collect_formant_data_from_files.praat" by 
# Mietta Lennes, available here: http://www.helsinki.fi/~lennes/praat-scripts/
# This script was first modified by Dan McCloy (drmccloy@uw.edu) in December 2011 and
# later modified to add intensity and labels from other tiers by Esther Le GrÃ©zause (elg1@uw.edu) in May 2016.
