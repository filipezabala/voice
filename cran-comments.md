## Non-existent file
I just couldn't find the 'lastMiKTeXException' file/directory. I used  
`sudo find / -name lastMiKTeXException`  
`sudo find / -type d -name 'lastMiKTeXException'`  
`sudo find / -type f -name 'lastMiKTeXException`  
at linux terminal but there is no clue of this file/directory.
