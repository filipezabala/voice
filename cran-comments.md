## Non-existent file
I just couldn't find the 'qtsingleapp-mscore-7531-1f5-lockfil' file/directory. I used  
`sudo find / -name qtsingleapp-mscore-7531-1f5-lockfil`  
`sudo find / -type d -name 'qtsingleapp-mscore-7531-1f5-lockfil'`  
`sudo find / -type f -name 'qtsingleapp-mscore-7531-1f5-lockfil`  
at linux terminal but there is no clue of this file/directory.
