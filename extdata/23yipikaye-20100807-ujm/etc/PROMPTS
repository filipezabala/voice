23yipikaye-20100807-ujm/mfc/b0313 THE APRON STRING LOOMED NEAR AND HE SHIED LIKE AN UNBROKEN COLT

23yipikaye-20100807-ujm/mfc/b0315 AND THIS WAS THEIR SOLE CONVERSATION THROUGHOUT THE MEAL
23yipikaye-20100807-ujm/mfc/b0316 THOUGH THE AURORA STILL FLAMED ANOTHER DAY HAD BEGUN
23yipikaye-20100807-ujm/mfc/b0317 HE DID NOT BELIEVE IN THE BURNING OF DAYLIGHT FOR SUCH A LUXURY
23yipikaye-20100807-ujm/mfc/b0318 AGAIN HE HAD DONE THE BIG THING
23yipikaye-20100807-ujm/mfc/b0319 DAYLIGHT WAS TIRED PROFOUNDLY TIRED
23yipikaye-20100807-ujm/mfc/b0320 THE REGRET IN HIS VOICE WAS PROVOCATIVE OF A SECOND BURST OF LAUGHTER
23yipikaye-20100807-ujm/mfc/b0321 INSTEAD HE ARRIVED ON THE NIGHT OF THE SECOND DAY
