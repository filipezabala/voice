General tools for voice analysis. The `voice` package is being developed to be an easy-to-use set of tools to deal with audio analysis in R.  
It is based on [`tidyverse`](https://www.tidyverse.org/) collection, [`tuneR`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/tuneR/index.html), [`wrassp`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/wrassp/index.html), as well as [Parselmouth](https://github.com/YannickJadoul/Parselmouth) - a Python library for the [Praat](http://www.praat.org/) software - and [pyannote-audio](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio) - an open-source toolkit written in Python for speaker diarization based on [PyTorch](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch) machine learning framework.  
A vignette is found at http://filipezabala.com/voicegnette/.

## MacOS Installation
The following steps were used to configure [github.com/filipezabala/voice](https://github.com/filipezabala/voice) on [MacOS Big Sur](https://www.apple.com/macos/big-sur/). Note the software versions during installation, inconsistency reporting is welcome.  
If the error "The package %@ is missing or invalid" appears during the upgrading from MacOS Catalina to Big Sur, press simultaneously `command + option + p + r` at restart. The processes may be accompanied using the keys `command + space 'Activity Monitor'`.    
> Without the following Python items 3 and 10, you may run all the functions except `poetry` and `extract_features_py`, that run respectively [pyannote-audio](https://github.com/pyannote/pyannote-audio) and [Parselmouth](https://github.com/YannickJadoul/Parselmouth).
